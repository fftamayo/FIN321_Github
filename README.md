My name is Frederick Tamayo Jr., and I’m currently a Senior majoring in Accounting and Finance.

Academic/Professional Interests:
I’m interested in audit and assurance services, financial analysis, and business consulting. I enjoy learning how financial data can be used to improve business decision-making and efficiency.

Skills (Languages, Tools):
I’m proficient in Microsoft Excel, Google Workspace, and QuickBooks, and have experience with financial reporting and bookkeeping through both coursework and my audit internship with Accuity. I also have strong communication, organization, and leadership skills, developed through my involvement in the Accounting Club, Beta Alpha Psi, and running my own DJ/sound system rental business.

Fun Facts and Career Goals:
Outside of academics, I enjoy powerlifting, fishing, watching sunsets, and spending time with family and friends. My career goal is to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and eventually advance into a leadership role in public accounting or business advisory.
