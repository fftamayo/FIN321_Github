Executive Summary
Our firm will receive €20,000,000 in one year from a European aircraft parts buyer. With the EUR/USD spot at 1.174 and 1-year forward at 1.0935, our expected proceeds in USD range from $21.9 million today to $21.87 million under the forward rate. The exposure lies in euro depreciation, which would reduce our USD cash inflow and distort reported earnings. This memo outlines the risk, compares three hedge options—forward contract, currency option, and money-market hedge—and presents a plan for modeling their outcomes. The goal is to stabilize USD receipts and recommend the most cost-effective strategy in later stages.

Background & Objectives
Exposure: €20,000,000 receivable in 12 months.
Risk: If the euro weakens (e.g., from 1.17 → 1.05), USD receipts could fall by nearly $2.4 million. Strengthening of the dollar would negatively impact revenue projections and financial ratios.
Objective: Quantify and hedge this FX risk to ensure predictable dollar inflows while maintaining flexibility.

Methods
1. Forward Contract – Lock in 1.0935 USD/EUR.
Pros: Eliminates risk; simple execution.
Cons: No upside if euro strengthens.
 2. Currency Option (Put on EUR, K ≈ 1.174, premium = $0.019)
Pros: Protects downside; retains upside potential.
Cons: Premium cost; option pricing complexity.
 3. Money-Market Hedge – Borrow euros, convert to USD now, invest USD, repay euro loan with receivable.
Pros: Non-derivative; fixes USD amount.
Cons: Operational complexity; funding required.

Technical Specification & Excel Model Build
Inputs:
Spot = 1.174, Forward = 1.0935
USD rate = 4.25 %, EUR rate = 2.15 %
Option premiums: Put = 0.019, Call = 0.024


Outputs:
USD receipts under ±10 % EUR/USD changes
Effective hedge rate for each strategy
Chart of USD proceeds vs. exchange rate


Excel Tasks: Create formulas to calculate USD proceeds for each hedge, a sensitivity table, and chart.

Prompt Engineering (for AI automation)
“Generate an Excel model comparing unhedged, forward, option, and money-market hedges for a €20 million receivable due in one year. Include input cells for spot, forward, interest rates, option premiums, and output tables of USD proceeds under ±10 % EUR/USD scenarios.”

Final Analysis & Recommendation
Preliminary data suggest a forward contract offers the cleanest hedge and cost certainty. Stages 2–3 will test blended strategies (e.g., 50 % forward + 50 % option) to evaluate upside participation against premium cost. Final recommendation will prioritize budget stability and risk reduction.
